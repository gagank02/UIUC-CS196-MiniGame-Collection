# My Role
I was the sole-developer of the Green Light Red Light game, as well as creating the Main Menu UI and Game Over screen. I was in charge of making sure that the Main Menu was able to run all the games from one hub, as well as being able to return back to the Main Menu from the Game Over screen. When on the Game Over screen, I also implemented a score display that would display the player's score from the game they just played.
